The purpose of the Merrelles project is to create a sly Nine Men's Morris
opponent that is "write once run anywhere".
The author, Paul Sullivan, first played Nine Men's Morris in Lausanne, Switzerland,
where a Morris board is built into the pavement at Place de la Riponne.
An important goal of this project is to create a game that is equally appealing.
