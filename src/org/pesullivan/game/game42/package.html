Provides generic classes that generate deterministic 2 player strategy
game behaviour.  This Java package was produced by Paul Sullivan
based on his earlier work in C++ based on his earlier work in C.
Each work is an evolutionary improvement both in design and language technology.
Java will always be slower than C++ but it is still the best language
for platform independence.
<p>
Evolution of the <b>Game For Two</b> package began in 1985 when Paul received
as a birthday present, a book called <b><i>The Joy of Computer Chess by David Levy</i></b>.
In that year, Paul developed a Wari game called Kalah in <b>C</b> utilizing most of the algorithms described in the book.
Kalah was displayed on a data voice VT220 terminal connected by twisted pair
to the Unix based Nortel Meridian DV1.  At this time the game engine was not abstracted for re-use.
The Meridian DV1 had a 68000 processor running at around 6MHz.
<p>
Then in 1995, Paul refactored the game engine portion of Kalah
to be completely reusable by any strategy game.
This was achieved using C++ templates to optimize by favoring inline instructions
and minimizing vtable indirection.  Kalah ran on Windows 95.
<p>
In 2000, Paul translated his C++ game engine
into the existing Java <b>Game42</b> implementation.  It is easy to reuse the Game42 engine
because all of the complex AlphaBeta search optimizations are encapsulated within
protected classes <i>Turn</i> and <i>Plan</i>.  <i>Turn</i> searches possible moves
looking way ahead and recording the best <i>Plan</i>s for consecutive turns.
Recorded <i>Plan</i>s are cached and reused by <i>Game</i> for optimizing future searches.
<p>
In 2012, Paul created an HTML5 canvas based UI called <a href="http://merrelles.com" target="_top">Merrelles Mobile</a>,
by compiling the original Java down to Javascript using Google Web Toolkit and interestingly Merrelles Mobile is only 5 times slower than the original Java Applet.
<p>
At present, 2014, processor speeds are approaching 8GHz, approximately 1000 times faster than in 1985!
